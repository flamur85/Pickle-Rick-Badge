# Pickle-Rick-Badge
A DIY interactive badge inspired by the Def Con community and hacker culture. This project combines LEDs, a motor, and sound effects to create a fun, programmable experience. Includes CTF functionality (coming soon hopefully) for challenges and button-triggered shows, designed for makers, hackers, and electronics enthusiasts.
